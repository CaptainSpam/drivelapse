DriveLapse is an Android app which allows you to make distance-lapse picture tours.  That is to say, it automatically takes pictures every X amount of distance.

This project is presently in a pre-alpha state.  It does its job with a somewhat unfriendly interface, but it's a start.

Examples of it in use:

  * [Short highway trip in southeastern Michigan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieT02uVqzpE)
  * [Driving from Lexington, KY to the Woodford Reserve Distillery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMfZuOevMS8)
